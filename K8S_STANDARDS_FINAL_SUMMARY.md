**Repository:** taylor-curran/oshift-demo-credit-scoring-engine  
**Branch:** devin/1754316288-k8s-standards-compliance-fixes  
**PR:** #146  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT & CI PASSING  
**Session:** https://app.devin.ai/sessions/5dacaa46878a40aba377b36dee076169

## Executive Summary

The k8s standards audit and compliance implementation has been **successfully completed**. All required k8s standards (Rules 02-06) have been implemented and verified:

✅ **Rule 02 - Pod Security Baseline**: Fully compliant  
✅ **Rule 03 - Image Provenance**: Fully compliant  
✅ **Rule 04 - Naming & Labels**: Fully compliant  
✅ **Rule 05 - Logging & Observability**: Fully compliant  
✅ **Rule 06 - Health Probes**: Fully compliant  

## Implementation Details

### Kubernetes Manifests Created
- `k8s/deployment.yaml` - Main application deployment with security contexts
- `k8s/service.yaml` - Service with Prometheus annotations
- `k8s/configmap.yaml` - Application configuration
- `k8s/ml-models-configmap.yaml` - ML models configuration
- `k8s/ingress.yaml` - TLS-enabled ingress with security annotations
- `k8s/networkpolicy.yaml` - Network security policies
- `k8s/kustomization.yaml` - Kustomize configuration with proper labels

### Application Enhancements
- Added Prometheus metrics dependency (`micrometer-registry-prometheus`)
- Added JSON logging dependency (`logstash-logback-encoder`)
- Created `logback-spring.xml` for structured JSON logging
- Updated `application.properties` for observability endpoints

### Compliance Verification
- **Tests Passing**: `mvn test` - 1 test run, 0 failures
- **CI Passing**: All GitHub Actions checks successful
- **JSON Logging**: Verified structured output with service metadata
- **Security**: Non-root execution, read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities
- **Resource Limits**: Memory limit set to 2048Mi (compliant with 2Gi guideline)

## Key Compliance Features

### Rule 02 - Pod Security Baseline ✅
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
```

### Rule 03 - Image Provenance ✅
```yaml
image: registry.bank.internal/credit-scoring-engine:3.1.0@sha256:7d865e959b2466f8239fcba23c8966c8c1eabd319d8e4f30fe9f8eba5c2b4b5d
```

### Rule 04 - Naming & Labels ✅
```yaml
labels:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine
  app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"
  app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking
  environment: prod
  managed-by: openshift
```

### Rule 05 - Logging & Observability ✅
- JSON logging to stdout for fluent-bit collection
- Prometheus metrics on port 8080
- Service annotations for auto-discovery

### Rule 06 - Health Probes ✅
- Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness`
- Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness`
- Startup probe: `/actuator/health`

## Final Status

**✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

- All k8s standards compliance requirements have been met
- PR #146 is ready for review and deployment
- CI checks are passing
- Application tests are successful
- JSON logging is working correctly

The credit scoring engine is now fully compliant with banking k8s standards and ready for production deployment.
