# K8s Standards Compliance Audit Report

## Overview
Auditing Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/` directory against the 5 k8s standards rules.

## Rule 01 - Resource Requests & Limits ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Main container: requests (500m CPU, 1228Mi memory), limits (1000m CPU, 2048Mi memory)
- Fluent-bit sidecar: requests (50m CPU, 64Mi memory), limits (100m CPU, 128Mi memory)
- All containers meet minimum requirements (≥50m CPU, ≥128Mi memory)
- Reasonable limits that prevent resource starvation

## Rule 02 - Pod Security Baseline ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true` ✅
- `securityContext.seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` ✅
- `securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` ✅
- `securityContext.capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` ✅
- Applied to both main container and fluent-bit sidecar

## Rule 03 - Image Provenance ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Main container: `registry.bank.internal/credit-scoring-engine:3.1.0@sha256:...` (pinned with digest)
- Fluent-bit: `quay.io/redhat-openshift-approved/fluent-bit:2.1.10` (approved registry)
- No `:latest` tags used
- All images from approved registries

## Rule 04 - Naming & Label Conventions ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- All resources have mandatory labels:
  - `app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking`
  - `environment: prod`
  - `managed-by: helm`
- Naming follows convention: `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod`

## Rule 05 - Logging & Observability ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Prometheus annotations present:
  - `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`
  - `prometheus.io/port: "8080"`
- Health probes configured:
  - Liveness: `/actuator/health/liveness`
  - Readiness: `/actuator/health/readiness`
- Fluent-bit sidecar for log forwarding to Loki
- JSON logging configured in application.properties

## Issues Fixed in This Session
1. ✅ Corrected ingress service name references from `credit-scoring-engine` to `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod`
2. ✅ Fixed ingress service port from 8080 to 80 (correct service port)
3. ✅ Optimized resource limits (reduced CPU from 2000m to 1000m)
4. ✅ Adjusted JVM heap size to match memory limits
5. ✅ Resolved merge conflicts while maintaining compliance

## Final Assessment
**OVERALL STATUS: FULLY COMPLIANT** ✅

All Kubernetes manifests now meet the requirements of k8s standards Rules 01-05. The configurations follow security best practices, use appropriate resource limits, implement proper observability, and maintain consistent labeling conventions.
