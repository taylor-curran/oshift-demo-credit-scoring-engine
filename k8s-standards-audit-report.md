# K8s Standards Compliance Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit assesses the Kubernetes manifests in the `k8s/` directory against the k8s-standards-library Rules 02-06. The manifests show strong compliance with most standards but have some areas for improvement.

## Standards Compliance Assessment

### Rule 02 - Security Context ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status: FULLY COMPLIANT**

Both main application and fluent-bit sidecar containers implement all required security settings:
- ✅ `runAsNonRoot: true` - Prevents running as root user
- ✅ `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` - Applies runtime default seccomp profile  
- ✅ `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` - Makes root filesystem read-only
- ✅ `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` - Drops all Linux capabilities

**Location**: `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 33-39, 112-118

### Rule 03 - Image Provenance ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**

- ✅ Uses pinned image tags with SHA digests (no `:latest`)
- ✅ Images from approved registry: `registry.bank.internal/*`
- ⚠️ **ISSUE**: SHA digests are placeholders (`abc123def...`, `def456789...`)

**Required Action**: Replace placeholder SHA digests with actual image digests from container registry.

**Location**: `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 32, 111

### Rule 04 - Naming & Labels ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status: FULLY COMPLIANT**

All resources implement proper naming conventions and mandatory labels:
- ✅ Release name prefix: `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod` (follows `<team>-<app>-<env>` pattern)
- ✅ All mandatory labels present:
  - `app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking`
  - `environment: prod`
  - `managed-by: helm`

**Location**: All manifests in `k8s/` directory

### Rule 05 - Logging & Observability ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status: FULLY COMPLIANT**

- ✅ Prometheus scraping annotations present:
  - `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`
  - `prometheus.io/port: "8080"`
- ✅ Fluent-bit sidecar configured for JSON log shipping to Loki
- ✅ Metrics exposed on port 8080
- ✅ Centralized logging configuration via ConfigMap

**Location**: `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 27-28, `k8s/service.yaml` lines 13-14, `k8s/configmap.yaml`

### Rule 06 - Health Probes ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status: FULLY COMPLIANT**

Spring Boot Actuator endpoints properly configured:
- ✅ Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness` (30s initial delay, 3 failure threshold)
- ✅ Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness` (10s initial delay, 1 failure threshold)
- ✅ Appropriate timeouts and failure thresholds

**Location**: `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 93-104

### Rule 01 - Resource Limits ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status: FULLY COMPLIANT** (Bonus compliance check)

- ✅ Main container: CPU 500m-2000m, Memory 1200Mi-2048Mi
- ✅ Fluent-bit sidecar: CPU 50m-200m, Memory 128Mi-256Mi
- ✅ Requests ≈ 60% of limits for HPA headroom
- ✅ All containers have both requests and limits defined

**Location**: `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 43-49, 119-125

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Placeholder SHA Digests (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Image references use placeholder SHA digests that must be replaced with actual digests.

**Current**:
```yaml
image: registry.bank.internal/credit-scoring-engine:3.1.0@sha256:abc123def456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
image: registry.bank.internal/fluent-bit:2.1.0@sha256:def456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456
```

**Required Action**: Update with actual SHA digests from container registry before deployment.

## Recommendations

1. **Image SHA Updates**: Replace placeholder SHA digests with actual image digests from your container registry
2. **Environment Testing**: Test in non-production environment due to security constraints (non-root, read-only filesystem)
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Verify Prometheus and Loki integration in target cluster
4. **Security Review**: Validate that read-only filesystem doesn't impact application file operations

## Overall Compliance Score

**5/6 Rules Fully Compliant (83%)**
- Rule 02 (Security Context): ✅ PASS
- Rule 03 (Image Provenance): ⚠️ NEEDS SHA UPDATES  
- Rule 04 (Naming & Labels): ✅ PASS
- Rule 05 (Logging & Observability): ✅ PASS
- Rule 06 (Health Probes): ✅ PASS
- Rule 01 (Resource Limits): ✅ PASS (Bonus)

## Conclusion

The Kubernetes manifests demonstrate excellent compliance with k8s-standards-library requirements. The only remaining issue is updating placeholder SHA digests with actual image digests from the container registry. Once resolved, the manifests will be fully compliant with all standards rules.
