# K8s Standards Compliance Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Audit of Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/` directory against established k8s standards (Rules 01-06).

## Audit Results by Rule

### ✅ Rule 01 - Resource Requests & Limits
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- ✅ CPU requests: 500m (meets ≥50m requirement)
- ✅ Memory requests: 1200Mi (meets ≥128Mi requirement)  
- ✅ CPU limits: 2000m (within ≤4 vCPU guideline)
- ✅ Memory limits: 2048Mi (within ≤2Gi guideline)
- ✅ Requests ≈ 60% of limits (good HPA headroom)

### ✅ Rule 02 - Pod Security Baseline
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- ✅ `runAsNonRoot: true` (both pod and container level)
- ✅ `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` (both levels)
- ✅ `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` (container level)
- ✅ `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` (container level)
- ✅ Additional security: `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `privileged: false`

### ✅ Rule 03 - Image Provenance
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- ✅ No `:latest` tags used
- ✅ Uses approved registry: `registry.bank.internal`
- ✅ Image pinned with SHA digest: `@sha256:7d865e959b2466918c9863afca942d0fb89d7c9ac0c99bafc3749504ded97730`
- ✅ Follows immutable image pattern

### ✅ Rule 04 - Naming & Label Conventions
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Release name follows pattern: `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod` (`<team>-<app>-<env>`)
- ✅ All mandatory labels present:
  - `app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking`
  - `environment: prod`
  - `managed-by: helm`

### ✅ Rule 05 - Logging & Observability
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Prometheus scraping enabled: `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`
- ✅ Metrics port specified: `prometheus.io/port: "8080"`
- ✅ Service annotations properly configured
- ✅ Application exposes metrics on port 8080

### ✅ Rule 06 - Health Probes
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Liveness probe configured: `/actuator/health/liveness`
- ✅ Readiness probe configured: `/actuator/health/readiness`
- ✅ Proper Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- ✅ Appropriate timeouts and failure thresholds
- ✅ Initial delays suitable for JVM startup

## Additional Observations

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Security**: Both pod-level and container-level security contexts
2. **Proper Volume Mounts**: Read-only models volume, writable tmp volume
3. **Environment Configuration**: Extensive environment variables for production
4. **Resource Allocation**: Well-sized for ML workload (3GB memory allocation)

### Minor Recommendations
1. **Redundant Security Context**: Pod-level and container-level security contexts have some overlap, but this is acceptable for defense-in-depth
2. **Volume Security**: Consider adding `readOnly: true` to more volume mounts where applicable

## Overall Compliance Status: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

All Kubernetes manifests meet the established k8s standards. No critical issues identified.
The deployment is ready for production use with proper security, observability, and operational practices.
