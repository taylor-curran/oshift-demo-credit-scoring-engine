## Audit Results by Rule

### ✅ Rule 01 - Resource Limits & Requests
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- CPU requests: 600m, limits: 1000m

- Follows 60% rule of thumb for requests vs limits
- All containers have proper resource constraints

### ✅ Rule 02 - Security Context
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- `runAsNonRoot: true` ✅
- `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` ✅
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` ✅
- `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` ✅
- Applied to both main container and fluent-bit sidecar

### ✅ Rule 03 - Image Provenance
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Uses pinned image with SHA digest: `registry.bank.internal/credit-scoring-engine:3.1.0@sha256:...` ✅
- Registry from allowlist: `registry.bank.internal/*` ✅
- No `:latest` tags used ✅

### ✅ Rule 04 - Naming & Labels
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- All mandatory labels present:
  - `app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine` ✅
  - `app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"` ✅
  - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking` ✅
  - `environment: prod` ✅
  - `managed-by: openshift` ✅
- Naming convention: `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod` ✅

### ✅ Rule 05 - Logging & Observability
**Status: FIXED IN THIS PR**
- **FIXED**: Prometheus metrics path corrected from `/actuator/prometheus` to `/metrics`
- **ADDED**: Fluent-bit sidecar container for JSON log collection
- **ADDED**: Fluent-bit ConfigMap with proper JSON parsing configuration
- Prometheus annotations: `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`, `prometheus.io/port: "8080"`, `prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"` ✅
- JSON logging to stdout configured via logback-spring.xml ✅

### ✅ Rule 06 - Health Probes
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness` (30s initial delay, 3 failure threshold) ✅
- Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness` (10s initial delay, 3 failure threshold) ✅
- Startup probe: `/actuator/health` (30s initial delay, 30 failure threshold) ✅

## Changes Made in This PR

### Files Modified
1. **k8s/deployment.yaml**:
   - Fixed Prometheus metrics path annotation from `/actuator/prometheus` to `/metrics`
   - Added fluent-bit sidecar container with proper security context
   - Added volume mounts for fluent-bit configuration

2. **k8s/service.yaml**:
   - Added `prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"` annotation

3. **k8s/kustomization.yaml**:
   - Added `fluent-bit-configmap.yaml` to resources list

4. **k8s/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml** (NEW):
   - Created ConfigMap for fluent-bit JSON log processing
   - Configured log forwarding to OpenShift Loki stack
   - JSON parser configuration for structured logging

## Testing Results

- ✅ `mvn test` passes successfully
- ✅ JSON logging output confirmed in test logs
- ✅ All Kubernetes manifests syntax validated
- ✅ Security contexts maintained across all containers

## Compliance Status Summary

| Rule | Status | Issues Found | Fixes Applied |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Rule 01 | ✅ COMPLIANT | None | N/A |
| Rule 02 | ✅ COMPLIANT | None | N/A |
| Rule 03 | ✅ COMPLIANT | None | N/A |
| Rule 04 | ✅ COMPLIANT | None | N/A |
| Rule 05 | ✅ FIXED | Incorrect metrics path, missing fluent-bit | Corrected path, added sidecar |
| Rule 06 | ✅ COMPLIANT | None | N/A |

**Overall Compliance: 100% ✅**

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor fluent-bit logs** after deployment to ensure proper log forwarding to Loki
2. **Verify Prometheus scraping** is working with the corrected `/metrics` path
3. **Consider adding resource limits** for fluent-bit sidecar in production (currently set to 100m CPU, 128Mi memory)

## Next Steps

1. Create PR with these compliance fixes
2. Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful deployment
3. Validate observability stack integration in target environment
