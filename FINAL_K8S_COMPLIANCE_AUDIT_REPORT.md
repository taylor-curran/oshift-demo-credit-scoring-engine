### ✅ Rule 05 - Logging & Observability
**Status:** COMPLIANT
- Prometheus annotations on deployment and service ✅
- `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` ✅
- `prometheus.io/port: "8080"` ✅
- `prometheus.io/path: "/actuator/prometheus"` ✅
- JSON logging configured via `logback-spring.xml` ✅
- Structured logging with service metadata ✅

## Technical Validation Results

### YAML Syntax Validation
- ✅ k8s/configmap.yaml - Valid YAML
- ✅ k8s/deployment.yaml - Valid YAML
- ✅ k8s/ingress.yaml - Valid YAML
- ✅ k8s/kustomization.yaml - Valid YAML
- ✅ k8s/ml-models-configmap.yaml - Valid YAML
- ✅ k8s/networkpolicy.yaml - Valid YAML
- ✅ k8s/service.yaml - Valid YAML

### Application Testing
- ✅ Maven build: SUCCESS
- ✅ Unit tests: 1 test run, 0 failures
- ✅ JSON logging: Working correctly with structured output
- ✅ Application startup: Clean startup and shutdown

### Kubernetes Manifests Created
- `k8s/deployment.yaml` - Main application deployment with security contexts
- `k8s/service.yaml` - Service with Prometheus annotations
- `k8s/configmap.yaml` - Application configuration
- `k8s/ml-models-configmap.yaml` - ML models configuration
- `k8s/ingress.yaml` - TLS-enabled ingress with security annotations
- `k8s/networkpolicy.yaml` - Network security policies
- `k8s/kustomization.yaml` - Kustomize configuration with proper labels

### Application Enhancements
- Added Prometheus metrics dependency (`micrometer-registry-prometheus`)
- Added JSON logging dependency (`logstash-logback-encoder`)
- Created `logback-spring.xml` for structured JSON logging
- Updated `application.properties` for observability endpoints

## Security Features Implemented

### Pod Security
- Non-root execution (UID 1001)
- Read-only root filesystem
- All capabilities dropped
- Privilege escalation disabled
- Runtime default seccomp profile

### Network Security
- NetworkPolicy with ingress/egress rules
- TLS-enabled ingress
- Restricted port access

### Image Security
- Signed images from internal registry
- SHA256 digest verification
- No mutable tags

## Observability Features

### Metrics
- Prometheus metrics endpoint: `/actuator/prometheus`
- Auto-discovery via service annotations
- Management port (8081) for health checks

### Logging
- JSON structured logging to stdout
- Service metadata included in logs
- Compatible with fluent-bit sidecar collection

### Health Checks
- Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness`
- Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness`
- Startup probe: `/actuator/health`

## Final Recommendations

1. **Deployment Ready**: All k8s manifests are compliant and ready for production deployment
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Manifests can be integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines
3. **Monitoring**: Service will be auto-discovered by Prometheus for metrics collection
4. **Logging**: Logs will be collected by fluent-bit sidecar for central logging

## Conclusion

The credit scoring engine is now fully compliant with all banking k8s standards and ready for production deployment in OpenShift/Kubernetes environments. All security, observability, and operational requirements have been met.

**Final Status: ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**
