# Cloud Foundry to OpenShift Migration Todo List

## Phase 2: Scaffold Conversion
- [x] Create Dockerfile to replace CF buildpacks with container build (Java + Python support)
- [x] Generate Kubernetes Deployment manifest with resource limits and security context
- [x] Generate Kubernetes Service manifest (ClusterIP type)
- [x] Generate Kubernetes ConfigMap for environment variables
- [x] Generate Kubernetes Secret for sensitive credentials
- [x] Generate OpenShift Route for external access

## Phase 3: Standards Compliance
- [x] Apply Resource Limits (Rule 01) - requests ≥ 50m CPU, 128Mi memory; limits ≤ 4 vCPU, 2Gi memory
- [x] Apply Security Context (Rule 02) - runAsNonRoot, seccompProfile, readOnlyRootFilesystem, drop ALL capabilities
- [x] Apply Image Provenance (Rule 03) - pinned tags, approved registry, no :latest
- [x] Apply Naming & Labels (Rule 04) - proper app.kubernetes.io labels and naming conventions

## Phase 4: Build & Load Image Locally
- [x] Build Docker image locally using Dockerfile
- [x] Load image into local OpenShift/Kind cluster
- [x] Verify image builds successfully

## Phase 5: Deploy to Local OpenShift
- [ ] Create demo project/namespace
- [ ] Apply ConfigMap manifest
- [ ] Apply Secret manifest
- [ ] Apply Deployment manifest
- [ ] Apply Service manifest
- [ ] Apply Route manifest
- [ ] Monitor rollout status

## Phase 6: Assess Work Quality
- [ ] Verify all pods reach Running state
- [ ] Test health endpoint (/actuator/health/detailed)
- [ ] Check logs for startup errors
- [ ] Verify basic functionality matches CF deployment

## Phase 7: Finalize
- [ ] Create PR with all migration artifacts
- [ ] Wait for CI checks to complete
- [ ] Report results to user
