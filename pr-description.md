# K8s Standards Compliance Audit and Final Verification

## Summary

This PR provides a comprehensive audit and verification of the Credit Scoring Engine Kubernetes manifests against banking k8s standards (Rules 02-06). All manifests have been reviewed and are fully compliant with the required standards.

## Changes Made

### ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive Compliance Audit
- **Added**: `k8s-standards-compliance-final-audit.md` - Detailed audit report documenting full compliance
- **Verified**: All existing Kubernetes manifests meet banking k8s standards requirements

### âœ… Standards Compliance Status

**Rule 02 - Pod Security Baseline**: âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT
- `runAsNonRoot: true` at pod and container level
- `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` 
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
- `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`
- Proper volume mounts for read-only filesystem support

**Rule 03 - Image Provenance**: âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT  
- Tag pinning with SHA256 digest
- Approved registry: `registry.bank.internal/*`
- No `:latest` tags used

**Rule 04 - Naming & Label Conventions**: âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT
- All mandatory labels present: `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.kubernetes.io/version`, `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`, `environment`, `managed-by`
- Proper release name format: `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod`
- Consistent labeling across all resources

**Rule 05 - Logging & Observability**: âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT
- Prometheus annotations: `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`, `prometheus.io/port: "8080"`
- Spring Boot Actuator metrics endpoint configured
- JSON stdout logging enabled

**Rule 06 - Health Probes**: âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT
- Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness` with proper timing
- Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness` with proper timing

## Kubernetes Manifests Included

- `k8s/deployment.yaml` - Main application deployment with 4 replicas
- `k8s/service.yaml` - ClusterIP service with Prometheus annotations  
- `k8s/configmap.yaml` - ML models configuration
- `k8s/ingress.yaml` - Internal and external API access
- `k8s/namespace.yaml` - Dedicated namespace for isolation
- `k8s/kustomization.yaml` - Kustomize configuration with common labels

## Testing

- âœ… `mvn test` passes - Application builds and tests successfully
- âœ… All Kubernetes manifests validated against k8s standards
- âœ… Security contexts properly configured
- âœ… Resource limits and requests within acceptable ranges

## Production Readiness

This implementation provides:
- **Security**: Pod security baseline with non-root execution and capability dropping
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics and structured logging
- **Reliability**: Health probes and proper resource allocation
- **Compliance**: Full adherence to banking k8s standards
