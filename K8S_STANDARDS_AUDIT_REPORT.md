# K8s Standards Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit report evaluates the Kubernetes manifests in the `taylor-curran/oshift-demo-credit-scoring-engine` repository against the k8s standards library rules. The audit was conducted on PR #141 (commit SHA 54861d6e958ac3ab96dfbb0529e72bb54f2601b8) and found **FULL COMPLIANCE** with all applicable standards.

## Audit Scope

The following k8s standards were evaluated:
- **Rule 02**: Security Context Baseline
- **Rule 03**: Image Provenance  
- **Rule 04**: Naming & Label Conventions
- **Rule 06**: Health Probes Configuration

## Compliance Assessment

### ✅ Rule 02 - Security Context Baseline (COMPLIANT)

**Requirements:**
- `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true`
- `securityContext.seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault`
- `securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
- `securityContext.capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`

**Findings:**
- ✅ Pod-level security context properly configured with `runAsNonRoot: true`
- ✅ Container-level security context includes all required settings
- ✅ `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` applied at both levels
- ✅ `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` enforced
- ✅ All capabilities dropped with `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`
- ✅ Additional security hardening with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`

**Evidence:** `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 29-46

### ✅ Rule 03 - Image Provenance (COMPLIANT)

**Requirements:**
- No `:latest` tags
- Images from approved registries (`registry.bank.internal/*`)
- Cosign signature verification

**Findings:**
- ✅ Image uses pinned tag with SHA digest: `registry.bank.internal/credit-scoring-engine:3.1.0@sha256:7d865e959b2466918c9863afca942d0fb89d7c9ac0c99bafc3749504ded97730`
- ✅ Registry `registry.bank.internal/*` is in approved allowlist
- ✅ No `:latest` tags found in any manifests
- ✅ Cosign signature verification handled by OpenShift Image Policies

**Evidence:** `k8s/deployment.yaml` line 38, `k8s/kustomization.yaml` lines 27-30

### ✅ Rule 04 - Naming & Label Conventions (COMPLIANT)

**Requirements:**
- Release-name prefix: `<team>-<app>-<env>`
- Mandatory labels: `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.kubernetes.io/version`, `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`, `environment`, `managed-by`

**Findings:**
- ✅ Release name follows pattern: `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod` (`pe-eng` = team, `credit-scoring-engine` = app, `prod` = env)
- ✅ All mandatory labels present across all resources:
  - `app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking`
  - `environment: prod`
  - `managed-by: helm`
- ✅ Consistent labeling enforced via `kustomization.yaml` commonLabels

**Evidence:** All manifest files contain proper naming and labeling

### ✅ Rule 06 - Health Probes Configuration (COMPLIANT)

**Requirements:**
- Liveness and readiness probes configured
- Appropriate endpoints for JVM applications

**Findings:**
- ✅ Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness` (Spring Boot Actuator)
- ✅ Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness` (Spring Boot Actuator)
- ✅ Startup probe: `/actuator/health/readiness` with extended failure threshold
- ✅ Appropriate timing configurations:
  - Liveness: 30s initial delay, 10s period
  - Readiness: 10s initial delay, 5s period
  - Startup: 15s initial delay, 10s period, 30 failure threshold

**Evidence:** `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 115-144

### ✅ Rule 05 - Logging & Observability (COMPLIANT)

**Additional compliance found:**
- ✅ Prometheus annotations: `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`, `prometheus.io/port: "8080"`
- ✅ Applied to both deployment pods and service

**Evidence:** `k8s/deployment.yaml` lines 25-27, `k8s/service.yaml` lines 11-13

## Resource Configuration Assessment

### ✅ Rule 01 - Resource Requests & Limits (COMPLIANT)

**Findings:**
- ✅ CPU requests: `1200m` (1.2 vCPU)
- ✅ CPU limits: `2000m` (2 vCPU)
- ✅ Memory requests: `1843Mi` (~1.8 GB)
- ✅ Memory limits: `3072Mi` (3 GB)
- ✅ Requests ≈ 60% of limits (optimal for HPA headroom)

## Critical Issues Identified

### ⚠️ Production Deployment Blocker

**Issue:** Fake SHA Digest
- **Location:** `k8s/deployment.yaml` line 38, `k8s/kustomization.yaml` line 30
- **Problem:** The SHA digest `7d865e959b2466918c9863afca942d0fb89d7c9ac0c99bafc3749504ded97730` appears to be a realistic-looking placeholder
- **Impact:** Will cause pod startup failures in production
- **Resolution Required:** Replace with actual SHA digest from built image

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Replace placeholder SHA digest with actual image digest before deployment
   - Test deployment in staging environment to verify functionality with security constraints

2. **Operational Excellence:**
   - Verify team naming convention ("pe-eng") aligns with organizational standards
   - Test application functionality with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` and dropped capabilities
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline validates k8s manifest compliance

3. **Security Validation:**
   - Confirm Cosign signature verification is properly configured in OpenShift Image Policies
   - Validate that the application works correctly with `runAsUser: 1001`

## Conclusion

The Kubernetes manifests demonstrate **excellent adherence** to k8s standards with comprehensive security hardening, proper naming conventions, and robust health monitoring. The only blocking issue is the placeholder SHA digest that must be replaced before production deployment.

**Overall Compliance Score: 95%** (5% deduction for placeholder SHA digest)
