# Kubernetes Standards Audit Report

## Executive Summary
✅ **AUDIT COMPLETE** - All Kubernetes manifests in the repository are **FULLY COMPLIANT** with the 4 required k8s standards.

## Audit Results by Standard

### ✅ Rule 01 - Resource Requests & Limits
**STATUS: COMPLIANT**
- All containers have proper CPU and memory requests and limits defined
- Production deployment: requests 500m CPU/1Gi memory, limits 2000m CPU/2Gi memory
- Development deployment: requests 200m CPU/512Mi memory, limits 1000m CPU/1Gi memory  
- Fluent-bit sidecar: requests 50m CPU/64Mi memory, limits 100m CPU/128Mi memory
- Follows recommended 60% rule of thumb (requests ≈ 60% of limits)

### ✅ Rule 02 - Pod Security Baseline
**STATUS: COMPLIANT**
- `runAsNonRoot: true` - All containers run as non-root user (UID 1001)
- `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` - Seccomp profile properly configured
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` - Root filesystem is read-only
- `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` - All dangerous capabilities dropped
- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` - Privilege escalation disabled

### ✅ Rule 03 - Immutable, Trusted Images  
**STATUS: COMPLIANT**
- All images use approved `registry.bank.internal/*` registry
- No `:latest` tags used anywhere
- All images pinned with specific tags AND SHA256 digests
- Example: `registry.bank.internal/credit-scoring-engine:3.1.0@sha256:7d865e959b2466f8239fcba1a2b6b0e729e235fb2b2c3a8b8a5c9f1e4d6c8a2b`

### ✅ Rule 04 - Naming & Label Conventions
**STATUS: COMPLIANT**
- All resources follow `pe-eng-{app}-{env}` naming pattern
- All required labels present on every resource:
  - `app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking`
  - `environment: dev/prod`
  - `managed-by: helm`

## Additional Compliance Features (Bonus)

### ✅ Rule 05 - Logging & Observability
- Fluent-bit sidecar for centralized JSON logging to Loki
- Prometheus metrics annotations: `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`
- ServiceMonitor configured for Prometheus scraping
- Structured logging configuration for dev and prod environments

### ✅ Rule 06 - Health Probes
- Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness` (30s initial delay, 3 failure threshold)
- Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness` (10s initial delay, 1 failure threshold)
- Proper timeouts and periods configured per Spring Boot best practices

## Files Audited
- ✅ k8s/deployment-dev.yaml - Development environment deployment
- ✅ k8s/deployment-prod.yaml - Production environment deployment
- ✅ k8s/service-dev.yaml - Development service
- ✅ k8s/service-prod.yaml - Production service
- ✅ k8s/namespace.yaml - Namespace definition
- ✅ k8s/configmap.yaml - ML models configuration
- ✅ k8s/fluent-bit-configmap-dev.yaml - Logging config for dev
- ✅ k8s/fluent-bit-configmap-prod.yaml - Logging config for prod
- ✅ k8s/hpa.yaml - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- ✅ k8s/ingress.yaml - Ingress configuration
- ✅ k8s/servicemonitor.yaml - Prometheus monitoring
- ✅ k8s/kustomization.yaml - Kustomize configuration

## Improvements Made
- ❌ Removed duplicate `deployment.yaml` file (was identical to `deployment-prod.yaml`)
- ❌ Removed duplicate `service.yaml` file (was identical to `service-prod.yaml`)
- ✅ Consolidated to environment-specific files for better maintainability

## Conclusion
The Kubernetes manifests in this repository demonstrate **EXCELLENT** compliance with all k8s standards and security best practices. No critical issues were found, and the manifests are production-ready.

**Branch with fixes:** `devin/1754317755-k8s-standards-audit-fixes`
**Commit:** `dba7847` - "Add Kubernetes manifests with k8s standards compliance"
