# K8s Standards Compliance Assessment

## Current Status Assessment for Credit Scoring Engine

### Rule 01 - Resource Requests & Limits ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Main container: requests (600m CPU, 1843Mi memory), limits (1000m CPU, 3072Mi memory)
- Fluent-bit sidecar: requests (120m CPU, 154Mi memory), limits (200m CPU, 256Mi memory)
- All containers have proper resource constraints
- Requests are ~60% of limits (good for HPA headroom)

### Rule 02 - Pod Security Baseline ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- `runAsNonRoot: true` ✅
- `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` ✅
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` ✅
- `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` ✅
- Both main container and fluent-bit sidecar have proper security contexts

### Rule 03 - Image Provenance ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Main image: `registry.bank.internal/credit-scoring-engine:3.1.0@sha256:...` (pinned with SHA)
- Fluent-bit image: `quay.io/redhat-openshift-approved/fluent-bit:2.1.10@sha256:...` (approved registry)
- No `:latest` tags used
- Images from approved registries only

### Rule 04 - Naming & Labels ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Release name follows pattern: `pe-eng-credit-scoring-engine-prod`
- All mandatory labels present:
  - `app.kubernetes.io/name: credit-scoring-engine`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/version: "3.1.0"`
  - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retail-banking`
  - `environment: prod`
  - `managed-by: helm`

### Rule 05 - Logging & Observability ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Prometheus annotations on both deployment and service:
  - `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`
  - `prometheus.io/port: "8080"`
- Fluent-bit sidecar configured for JSON log shipping to Loki
- Application exposes metrics on port 8080

### Rule 06 - Health Probes ✅
**Status: COMPLIANT**
- Liveness probe: `/actuator/health/liveness`, 30s initial delay, 3 failure threshold
- Readiness probe: `/actuator/health/readiness`, 10s initial delay, 1 failure threshold
- Proper Spring Boot Actuator endpoints used

## Overall Assessment: FULLY COMPLIANT ✅

All k8s standards (Rules 01-06) are properly implemented in the current manifests.
